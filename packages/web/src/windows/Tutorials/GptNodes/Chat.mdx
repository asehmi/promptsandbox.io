## Introduction
The Chat Node allows you to build conversations with the OpenAI Chat API.
This node expects a chain of connected Chat Message nodes and aggregates
their contents to form a conversation sequence. Users can also customize the
request settings for the API call.

## Usage
1. Drag and drop the Chat Node onto the canvas.
2. Create a chain of Chat Message nodes by connecting them sequentially.
Make sure the last Chat Message node in the sequence connects to the
Chat Node.
3. Configure the content and role (user, assistant, or system) of each Chat
Message node in the chain.
4. In the Chat Node settings panel, adjust the API request settings as
needed, such as temperature, model, and stop sequence.
5. When the workflow is executed, the Chat Node will collect all the
messages in the sequence and send them to the OpenAI Chat API. The API
will then generate a response based on the conversation history and the
configured settings.
