Nodes are pieces of code that carry out a particular task. They serve as the foundation for a work process.
These nodes are linked together to form a sequence, with each node having its own purpose and the ability to 
connect with others in order to send its data.

The majority of these nodes require an OpenAI API key, as mentioned in the [Overview](link-to-overview-section).

## GPT Nodes
- **Chat**: Utilizes the OpenAI Chat API, which expects a list of messages representing a conversation and 
generates responses in a conversational tone. Suitable for few-shot prompting.
    - **Chat Message**: Functions as a chat message, designed to link with the Chat node
- **Complete**: Accesses the OpenAI Completion API, which acts like a highly advanced autocompletion system.


## Helper Nodes
- **Text**: Provides constant text as input for other nodes
- **Text Input**: Requests user input, saved as text, to be used as input for other nodes
- **Text Output**: Presents text output to the user
- **Classify**: Categorizes text based on user-defined classifications

## File Nodes
- **File Text**: Reads a file and outputs its text content
- **File Search**: Reads a file and outputs text matching a specific search query
- **Combine**: Merges multiple file objects into a single text
Note: To use File Nodes, you'll need to upload your files first in the Files tab on the navbar. Currently, only txt 
files are supported, but support for other file types like pdf, markdown, html, and docx will be added in the future. 

**Note**: Some nodes have constraints when connecting to other nodes. Detailed constraints will be provided in each node's section of the documentation.

You are currently limited to these predefined set of nodes. Custom node creation 
may be added in the future based on user demand.
