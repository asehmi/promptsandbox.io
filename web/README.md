Chatbutler.ai is a node-based visual canvas designed to help you create chatbots powered by OpenAI APIs. With an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, you can build dynamic chains of nodes, each performing a specific operation as part of the workflow. This project is built using React, focusing primarily on OpenAI APIs and providing a seamless experience for you to work with these APIs.

## Demo
1. Check out the demo here: [https://app.Chatbutler.ai/](https://app.Chatbutler.ai/)
2. Enter your OpenAI API key by clicking the button at the top left corner.

## Features
- Node-based visual interface for creating chatbots.
- Integration with OpenAI APIs, including Chat and Completion APIs.
- Document upload and retrieval.
- Support for various block types, such as User Input/Output, Chat API, Loops, Conditionals, and more.
- Debugging tools, such as breakpoints and running specific nodes, for inspecting the data passed between blocks.
- Chatbot gallery.
- Extensibility with additional node types for more complex chatbots.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- NPM/Yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository, change to the project directory, and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Chatbutler.ai.git
    cd Chatbutler.ai
    yarn install
    ```

2. Add a .env file in /supabase/

    ```bash
    PGSODIUM_SECRET_KEY=any-random-string
    ```

3. Set up Supabase Local instance. You can follow the guide [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) or follow the following steps: Install Supabase CLI

    ```bash
    # MacOS
    brew install supabase/tap/supabase

    # Windows
    scoop bucket add supabase https://github.com/supabase/scoop-bucket.git
    scoop install supabase

    # Linux
    brew install supabase/tap/supabase
    ```

4. Make sure docker is running and start local supabase instance. You may need to create a Supabase account and run `supabase login` first.

    ```bash
    supabase start
    ```

5. Add another .env file in src/pages/ and include the environment variables. You can get these values by running `supabase status` or the first time you ran supabase start:

    ```bash
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL= #API URL value from supabase status
    VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLIC_API= # anon key value
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE= # service_rol key
    ```

6. Run `supabase functions serve` to run all the edge functions locally. Make sure supabase CLI is at least `v1.38.6`.

7. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

8. Finally, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to access Chatbutler.ai ðŸŽ‰.

## Usage

1. Select and drag nodes from the left panel onto the canvas to start building your chatbot.
2. Connect nodes by dragging a line from the output of one node to the input of another.
3. Configure node settings and input values as needed.
4. Provide an OpenAI API key by clicking the button at the bottom left corner and entering your key.
5. Execute the chatbot to see the results generated by interacting with the OpenAI APIs.

## Roadmap

Future enhancements include:

- Integration with other AI models and APIs.
- Additional node types for more complex chatbots.
- Improved UI and UX for managing and visualizing the conversation flow.
- Gallery of example chatbots for various use cases.
